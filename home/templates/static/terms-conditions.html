We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify customer service at <a href="tel:+18888435849">+1 (888) 843-5849</a> or <a href="mailto:feedback@Ticketclue.com">feedback@Ticketclue.com</a> so that we have an opportunity to try to address your concerns.</p>

                            <h3>Protecting Your Security</h3>
                            <p>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we may validate your name, address and contact number supplied by you during the booking process against appropriate third-party databases. By accepting these Terms & Conditions you agree and authorize us to carry out such verification checks as stated herein. In performing these checks, you acknowledge and concur that such personal information you provide to us may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of such information in whole or in part. Rest assured this verification process is performed for the sole purpose to verify and confirm your identity, and that this process does not perform a credit check, and your credit rating will not be affected whatsoever. All information provided by you to us is securely processed in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998.</p>

                            <h3>ITE Usage and Ticket Purchase</h3>
                            <p>You warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and possess the legal authority to enter into this agreement and to use the Site in accordance with all Terms & Conditions herein. If you are using this Site and/or making travel reservations or bookings for another person you agree to inform that person(s) about the Terms & Conditions that apply to the travel reservations and bookings you have made on their behalf, including all rules and restrictions applicable thereto and these Terms & Conditions. You agree to be financially responsible for all of your use of the Site (as well as for use of your account by others). You are responsible for any bookings and travel reservations made by persons under your direction or control. You also warrant that all information supplied by you or on your behalf, or by members of your household in using the Site is true, current, complete and accurate. Furthermore, you also confirm that the traveler is not an unaccompanied minor. Without limitation, any exploratory, speculative, false, or fraudulent reservation or any reservation in anticipation of demand is prohibited.</p>

                            <p>Whenever you make use of a Site feature that allows you to upload material to the Site, or to make contact with other users of the Site, you must comply with applicable laws and the best standards of internet courtesy and behavior. You undertake that any such contribution does comply as aforementioned, and you irrevocably undertake to fully indemnify us at all times for any breach of that warranty and undertaking. Any material you upload to the Site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary and we have the right to use, copy, store, distribute and disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any material posted or uploaded by you to the Site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy.

We have the right to remove any material or posting you make on the Site if, in our opinion, such material does not comply with these Terms & Conditions.</p>

                            <h3>Cancel and Exchange</h3>
                            <p>Most of our airline tickets are non-refundable. In certain cases where the airline may allow customer-initiated cancellations, a credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveler on the same airline. Usually, the credit issued by the airline supplier has a specific expiration date, after which it cannot be used. The airline may have specific rules about fare type and booking class subject to availability for credit. We encourage you to discuss additional restrictions attached to your credit with a customer service agent. All such bookings where the cancellation may be permitted must be cancelled prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment by contacting our customer service. Cancellation requests are subject to the airline’s terms and conditions and those of tickets purchased. When you are ready to make your new booking and wish to use your airline credit, you will be required to pay fare difference (if any), applicable airline penalties and any applicable Ticket Clue post-ticketing fees. All such changes are governed by each airline's fare rules, policies and procedures, which are not under our control.</p>

                            <h3>Multiple Airline Itineraries</h3>
                            <p>If your itinerary includes flights operated by more than one airline, please read carefully each such airline's terms and conditions, which can be found on each such airline's website. Each such airline will have its own restrictions, rules and fees. If one of these flights is affected by an airline change (e.g., cancellation or rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the Customer may be responsible for any fees or ticket cost incurred for making changes to the unaffected flight. Such airlines may charge their own fees for changes, refunds, or if exchanges are requested. You are responsible for complying with each airline's terms and conditions, which may differ (for example, check-in times and limits on baggage size/weight). It is advisable you print your outbound and return portions of your e-ticket confirmation for all flights prior to traveling. You may be asked for proof of your return ticket at check-in.</p>
