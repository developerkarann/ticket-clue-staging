                <p>TicketClue.com was founded in 2010 by a group of travel enthusiasts who shared a common dream: to break down the barriers of international travel and make it accessible to everyone, everywhere. What began as a modest platform offering flight bookings has since evolved into a comprehensive travel ecosystem, serving over 14,000 customers across 200+ countries.</p>
                <p>The spark for TicketClue.com came during a backpacking trip across Southeast Asia, where our founders encountered the complexities of booking affordable flights, securing reliable accommodations, and navigating visa processes. Determined to simplify these challenges, they returned home and built a platform that combined cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of travelers' needs.</p>
                <p>Over the past decade, we've expanded our offerings to include hotel bookings, curated tour packages, cab services, and a full suite of travel assistance options. Our growth hasn't just been about adding services—it's been about perfecting the travel experience. From securing IATA certification to launching a mobile app in 2023, every step has been guided by our commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Today, TicketClue.com stands as a trusted name in the travel industry, recognized for its reliability, affordability, and personalized approach. Whether you're planning a solo adventure, a family vacation, or a business trip, we're here to turn your travel dreams into reality.</p>
